 # *Do I really need to install !OpenOffice.org in order to use JODConverter?*
  Yes. In fact, JODConverter simply automates OOo operations; all actual conversions are performed by OOo.
 # *Do I really really need to install !OpenOffice.org? There's no way to install only a few libraries/DLLs instead?*
  You do need a complete OOo installation. At most you can omit Base and a few optional component when installing.
  Splitting OOo conversion filters into independent components is one of the goals of an OOo sub-project called [http://odftoolkit.openoffice.org ODF Toolkit], but don't hold your breath.
 # *How well does it convert format X to format Y?*
  Different people have different requirements/expectations. Why don't you just find out for yourself? Since JODConverter simply automates OOo conversions, you don't even need to install JODConverter to do some tests, you just need OOo. Manually open a document in format X with OOo, and save it as (or export it to) format Y. Voil√†! No tricks, no gimmicks.
 # *When converting from format X to Y something is not quite right*
  As mentioned, JODConverter simply automates OOo conversions. 90% of the problems reported on the JODConverter group are actually OOo problems. Please try performing a manual conversion using OOo alone as explained in the previous answer. If you still get the same incorrect result, please report it an [http://qa.openoffice.org/issue_handling/project_issues.html OOo issue].
