= Building from source =

== Subversion Repository ==

The latest JODConverter source code is available from the Subversion repository. To check out the library do:
{{{
svn checkout http://jodconverter.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/jodconverter jodconverter
}}}

== Maven Build ==

JODConverter uses Maven 2 as its build tool, so it can be built in the usual Maven way:
{{{
cd jodconverter
mvn -Dmaven.test.skip package
}}}
and you should have `jodconverter-3.0-SNAPSHOT.jar` in the target dir.

You can build a ZIP distribution package containing all library dependencies with:
{{{
mvn assembly:assembly
}}}
which should result in a file called `jodconverter-3.0-SNAPSHOT-dist.zip` in the target dir.

Please see the [http://maven.apache.org Maven] website for more information about Maven.
